    <h1>Concept</h1>
    <p class="lede">
      <strong>Onus Probandi</strong> is a Queensland-set crime thriller short film in development. It's built around a single,
      escalating idea: what happens when the system needs certainty, but the evidence is unreliable? The story aims for high tension,
      grounded procedural realism, and a contemporary relevance that resonates with audiences who follow true crime, justice stories,
      and the modern conversation about forensic integrity.

    <h2>Logline</h2>
    <p>
      When detectives Daniel Bouric and Elise Watts pursue a case compromised by flawed forensic evidence,
      they race against political pressure and a manipulative offender who always seems one step ahead.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="panel">
    <h2>Extended synopsis</h2>
    <p>
      The story opens inside a Queensland investigative world that feels recognisable: fluorescent-lit offices, late-night phone calls,
      and the slow churn of a system that runs on procedures. A violent crime forces urgency onto the team. Detectives Daniel Bouric and
      Elise Watts are assigned the case and quickly find that the central piece of evidence--the one the system wants to rely upon--doesn't
      behave as expected. Where a modern investigation is supposed to lock into certainty through forensic results, this case starts to slip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bouric is pragmatic and experienced, the kind of detective who knows the system well enough to predict what it wants: a clean narrative,
      a strong suspect, a fast resolution. Watts brings a different energy--emotionally attuned, persistent, and willing to challenge assumptions.
      Together, their dynamic drives the film. As the investigation progresses, the usual structure of "evidence leads to truthÃ¢â‚¬Â becomes inverted.
      The detectives are not simply trying to solve a crime; they are trying to solve a crime while also proving that the method of solving it is still valid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pressure arrives from multiple directions. Supervisors want results. Public confidence matters. The work is watched. Meanwhile, the offender
      understands the environment and manipulates it. The antagonist is not a cartoon mastermind; the threat is realistic: someone who knows that
      loopholes, doubt, and procedural strain can create enough fog to disappear in plain sight. The case compresses into a short, intense period--days,
      not weeks--so the audience feels the same breathless urgency as the detectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      As their leads accumulate, the detectives encounter contradictions: witness timelines that don't align, forensic outputs that fail to confirm
      what "shouldÃ¢â‚¬Â be true, and subtle indications that someone is gaming the system. Bouric begins to feel the threat of professional fallout--if they
      push too hard against the accepted narrative, they risk becoming the story. Watts refuses to accept closure without confidence. Their relationship
      shifts from cooperative to strained and back again, as they each confront the question at the heart of the title: "onus probandiÃ¢â‚¬Â--the burden of proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thriller momentum is built not only from the fear of what the offender might do next, but from the fear that the system will force an outcome
      regardless of truth. The film climaxes when the detectives assemble enough human evidence--behaviour, pattern, motive, inconsistency--to move forward
      even when scientific certainty fails them. The resolution is designed to satisfy the thriller audience while keeping the thematic sting intact:
      justice is not a feeling; it's a standard, and that standard is under pressure.
    </p>

    <h2>Themes and relevance</h2>
    <div class="grid-3">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Trust under strain</h3>
        <p>
          The film explores the fragile agreement between the public and institutions: we trust the system because we believe it produces truth.
          When that trust cracks, every decision becomes political, personal, and urgent.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Certainty vs reality</h3>
        <p>
          Forensics is often treated as infallible in popular culture. Onus Probandi deliberately challenges that myth while respecting the real
          value of science and procedure. The tension comes from the gap between expectation and reality.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>The burden of proof</h3>
        <p>
          The title is not decorative. It's the engine of the story: when a case must be proven "beyond reasonable doubt,Ã¢â‚¬Â what happens if doubt is
          manufactured, or unavoidable, or systemic?
        </p>
      </article>
    </div>

    <p>
      This is not a lecture or a documentary, but it does benefit from topical relevance. It meets audiences where they already are: people are
      aware that systems can fail, and they are increasingly curious about the mechanisms of justice. That makes the concept strong for festival
      programming and media conversation, because it can be discussed without spoilers: it's a thriller that asks a question the public recognises.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="panel">
    <h2>Tone and style</h2>
    <p>
      The tone is tense and intelligent. The film aims for realism without becoming flat. Scenes are built around escalating stakes and clear objectives:
      every room has pressure in it, and every decision changes what the detectives can do next. Dialogue is tight, professional, and occasionally sharp.
      Humour is minimal and situational; the dominant feeling is momentum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visually, the concept leans into contrasts that Queensland naturally offers: sterile interiors versus humid night exteriors; controlled interview
      spaces versus raw suburban streets. The camera language should feel deliberate and "investigativeÃ¢â‚¬Â rather than flashy. When the story tightens,
      framing tightens. When the system looms, compositions become more rigid. When certainty collapses, the visual order starts to fray.
    </p>

        <h3>Lighting</h3>
        <p>
          Practical, motivated lighting: harsh fluorescent environments, hard shadows at night, and pools of streetlight. The goal is realism with
          cinematic polish.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Sound</h3>
        <p>
          A restrained thriller soundscape: room tone, distant traffic, fluorescent hum, procedural beeps. Score is minimal and tension-driven rather
          than melodic.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Pacing</h3>
        <p>
          Built for a short film format: quick scene-to-scene progression, strong cause-and-effect, escalating constraints, and a finish that leaves an echo.

    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p>
      Onus Probandi is character-driven inside a procedural frame. The leads are not superheroes. Their competence is real, but it's tested by limits,
      politics, and uncertainty. The villain is not defined by spectacle; the villain is defined by understanding how to exploit doubt.
    </p>

    <div class="grid-3">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Detective Daniel Bouric</h3>
        <p>
          Experienced and pragmatic. Bouric knows how outcomes are shaped inside institutions. He wants justice, but he also understands the danger of
          becoming the person who "couldn't close the case.Ã¢â‚¬Â His arc is learning that credibility is not preserved by safety.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Detective Elise Watts</h3>
        <p>
          Determined and emotionally intelligent. Watts refuses to accept answers that don't stand up to scrutiny. She is willing to challenge authority,
          and her drive creates friction--but it also saves the case. Her arc is learning how to carry truth through pressure without burning out.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Mike (offender)</h3>
        <p>
          Quietly manipulative, opportunistic, and observant. Mike understands what people want to believe. He operates in the space between what can be
          suspected and what can be proven. He doesn't need to "outsmart the detectives--he needs the system to hesitate.
        </p>
      </article>
    </div>

    <p>
      The supporting authority figure(s) serve as pressure valves. They are not "evil; they represent how systems behave under scrutiny: reduce risk,
      reduce uncertainty, control the narrative. This allows the film to keep its realism and avoid simplistic moral binaries. The antagonistic force is
      not only one person; it is the collision between human urgency and institutional standards.
    </p>

    <h2>Why this works as an investor-facing project</h2>
    <p>
      For a short film, Onus Probandi offers an unusually clear value proposition. It has a sharp hook, a timely subject, and a thriller framework
      that audiences immediately understand. This makes marketing and outreach simpler: the concept can be communicated in a sentence, but it also
      supports deeper discussion for partners who want substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project is designed to attract attention at multiple levels: festivals, local media, community partners, and collaborators. The Queensland setting
      is not incidental; it adds authenticity and provides a clear geographic identity that can be leveraged in promotion. The tone supports high production
      value even on a disciplined budget, because the film relies on tension, performance, and controlled environments rather than expensive spectacle.
