  <p>
    Let’s Not Google Meet is a feature documentary in development exploring Google transparency,
    platform accountability and digital governance in automated systems. The film investigates
    how algorithmic decision-making, escalation pathways and structured support systems affect
    small business visibility and institutional trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a platform accountability film, the project examines how modern digital infrastructure
    balances scale, automation and human oversight. Positioned within the broader field of
    digital governance documentary filmmaking, the work evaluates corporate responsibility
    frameworks, dispute resolution mechanisms and public transparency in technology systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Development is currently underway, with research interviews, documentation review and
    stakeholder outreach in progress. Festival submissions are targeted for 2027.
