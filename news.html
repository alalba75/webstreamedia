    <p>
      Webstreamedia has commenced development on a new feature documentary, <strong>Let’s Not Google Meet</strong>, examining platform transparency, customer escalation pathways and the evolving relationship between automated systems and small business visibility. 
      Originating from a documented case study and expanding into expert analysis, the project explores how digital infrastructure increasingly shapes commercial outcomes. 
      <cr>Through interviews, governance research and structured investigation, the film seeks to understand where accountability sits when algorithmic systems replace direct human interaction. 
      The documentary will position itself within the broader global conversation on digital due process and platform responsibility, with festival submissions targeted for 2027. 
      Development is currently underway, with stakeholder invitations issued and research interviews being scheduled.

    <p>
      Webstreamedia has commenced a new digital telecine of the original Super 16mm camera negatives to 4K for the documentary project
      <em>Blue Hermit</em>, bringing archival material into a modern post-production pipeline. The scan is being undertaken at high
      resolution by Roar Digital Melbourne, to preserve the texture, colour response and grain structure of the original film while enabling contemporary
      grading and finishing workflows. They utilise the latest Blackmagicdesign Ursa Telecine Chain equipment.
    </p>

    <p>
      This process allows legacy footage to be integrated seamlessly with newly shot digital material, ensuring visual continuity
      across the projectâ€™s evolving timeline. New scenes are currently being filmed this month to extend the narrative and deepen
      the observational scope of the documentary. Together, the restored archival footage and new photography form a cohesive visual
      record that reflects both the projectâ€™s history and its present direction.

    <p>
      <em>Onus Probandi</em> is a short dramatic film currently in development that explores the fragile boundary between accusation,
      evidence, and belief. Set against a restrained, contemporary Australian backdrop, the story follows a single incident as it
      ripples outward &mdash; exposing how institutions, relationships, and personal identity are shaped by who carries the burden of proof.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project blends subtle performance, minimalistic visual language, and carefully structured sound design to create a tense but
      intimate experience. Rather than focusing on spectacle, <em>Onus Probandi</em> draws its power from silence, implication, and the
      emotional cost of uncertainty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Development is currently focused on script refinement, tone testing, and early visual research, with production planning underway.
      The aim is to produce a tightly crafted short that resonates beyond its runtime and invites audiences to question their own
      assumptions about truth and responsibility.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Casting Announcments soon</strong></p>

    <p>
      Written by Chris Beadnell and the recipient of multiple international film making awards, <em>Onus Probandi</em> will be made
      locally in Queensland with an actual local cast and crew and not budget-friendly blow-ins to get a tax subsidy.
