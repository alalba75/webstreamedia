          <h3>Chris Beadnell</h3>
          <div class="crew-meta"><strong>Writer – Onus Probandi</strong></div>

          <p>
            Chris Beadnell is a filmmaker hailing from the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia, on Gubbi Gubbi country.
            With a decade of experience in scriptwriting, Chris has garnered numerous awards and accolades for his compelling screenplays.
          </p>

          <p>
            A turning point in his career was witnessing his script <em>Cliff&apos;s Edge</em> being produced as a short film.
            This experience ignited his passion for directing, leading him to undertake formal training and workshopping to direct his first short film,
            <em>The Note</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            This debut film and its script achieved great success, winning multiple awards worldwide, including <strong>Best Screenplay</strong> at the
            2024 International Film Festival of Australia and <strong>Best Male Director</strong> at the Power 24 Film Festival in South Africa.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chris recently produced and directed <em>Bingo Man</em> (short film). Chris&apos;s work is characterized by a strong humanist philosophy,
            deeply influenced by his years as a paramedic. This background allows him to explore the beauty, tragedy, and irony of life through his films.
          </p>

          <p>
            He collaborates openly with actors and crew, sharing his cinematic vision while challenging them to bring their best to each role.
            Chris draws inspiration from several renowned writer-directors, including Frank Darabont, Peter Weir, Christopher Nolan, and Quentin Tarantino.
          </p>

          <p>
            He is an active member of the Sunshine Coast Screen Collective and other industry organizations, where he networks and supports local and emerging
            film talent. Chris takes great pride in mentoring novice creatives, offering them their first opportunities in the industry while continuing his own
            development journey.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since his directorial debut, Chris has continued to direct and assist with other short films while maintaining his passion for writing. Chris has
            recently completed writing his first feature film, <em>Bingo Man</em> (an expansion of the short film) and plans to also write this in the limited
            series format.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chris remains open to any filmmaking offers or challenges, always eager to expand his creative horizons.
