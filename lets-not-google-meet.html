    <h2>Synopsis</h2>

    <p>
      Lets Not Google Meet is a feature documentary in development exploring
      digital transparency, platform accountability and governance within
      automated decision-making systems. The film investigates how scale,
      algorithmic workflows and institutional escalation pathways shape
      economic visibility and public trust.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through research interviews, documentation analysis and system mapping,
      the project examines the balance between automation and human oversight.
      The documentary positions itself within the broader discourse of digital
      governance and corporate accountability in platform-driven ecosystems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Development is currently underway, with stakeholder engagement and
      investigative research in progress. Festival submissions are targeted
      for 2027.

        <h3>The Case</h3>
        <p>
          A procedural platform decision triggers unexpected consequences.
          What first appears routine reveals deeper structural patterns
          embedded within automated governance systems.

        <h3>The Maze</h3>
        <p>
          Escalation pathways multiply while clarity diminishes. Appeals,
          forms and automated responses replace meaningful dialogue, exposing
          friction points within scaled infrastructure.

        <h3>The Investigation</h3>
        <p>
          Policy frameworks, correspondence and expert interviews uncover the
          architecture behind algorithmic decision-making and transparency
          mechanisms.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>The Stakes</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond individual impact lies a broader question of institutional
          trust, corporate responsibility and whether governance mechanisms
          evolve as rapidly as the technologies they regulate.
